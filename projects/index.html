        <section>
            <p>
                A few things I've built and written that I'm proud of — mostly focused on making information
                easier to use, and experiences more intuitive.
            </p>

                    <h2>Messaging App for Planning + Groups</h2>
                    <p>
                        A chat-style app built around real needs: making it easier for groups to plan events,
                        coordinate, and keep conversations organized without chaos.
                    </p>

                <section class="projectCard">
                    <h2>Online Board Game</h2>
                    <p>
                        A web-based board game designed to feel smooth and fair, even when multiple people are
                        playing at the same time. I cared a lot about clarity and making it easy to use.
                    </p>

                <section class="projectCard">
                    <h2>Satellite Communication Write-Up</h2>
                    <p>
                        A proposal that lays out how satellites could reliably talk to each other. I focused on
                        tricky situations (when things go wrong) and the tradeoffs between speed, reliability,
                        and simplicity.

                    <h2>NLP-Powered Research Finder</h2>
                    <p>
                        A project at J-PAL to help people find the right researchers and topics faster using
                        plain-language search — so evidence is easier to discover and easier to use.
